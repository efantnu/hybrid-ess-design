\section{Supplementary Data}

Supplementary Material should be uploaded separately on submission. Please include any supplementary data, figures and/or tables. All supplementary files are deposited to FigShare for permanent storage and receive a DOI.

Supplementary material is not typeset so please ensure that all information is clearly presented, the appropriate caption is included in the file and not in the manuscript, and that the style conforms to the rest of the article. To avoid discrepancies between the published article and the supplementary material, please do not add the title, author list, affiliations or correspondence in the supplementary files.

\section{Supplementary Tables and Figures}

For more information on Supplementary Material and for details on the different file types accepted, please see \href{http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#SupplementaryMaterial}{the Supplementary Material section} of the Author Guidelines.

Figures, tables, and images will be published under a Creative Commons CC-BY licence and permission must be obtained for use of copyrighted material from other sources (including re-published/adapted/modified/partial figures and images from the internet). It is the responsibility of the authors to acquire the licenses, to follow any citation instructions requested by third-party rights holders, and cover any supplementary charges.

\subsection{Figures}

%%% There is no need for adding the file termination, as long as you indicate where the file is saved. In the examples below the files (logo1.eps and logos.eps) are in the Frontiers LaTeX folder
%%% If using *.tif files convert them to .jpg or .png
%%%  NB logo1.eps is required in the path in order to correctly compile front page header %%%

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{logo1}% This is a *.eps file
\end{center}
\caption{ Enter the caption for your figure here.  Repeat as  necessary for each of your figures}\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{logos}
\end{center}
\caption{This is a figure with sub figures, \textbf{(A)} is one logo, \textbf{(B)} is a different logo.}\label{fig:2}
\end{figure}

%%% If you are submitting a figure with subfigures please combine these into one image file with part labels integrated.
%%% If you don't add the figures in the LaTeX files, please upload them when submitting the article.
%%% Frontiers will add the figures at the end of the provisional pdf automatically
%%% The use of LaTeX coding to draw Diagrams/Figures/Structures should be avoided. They should be external callouts including graphics.
